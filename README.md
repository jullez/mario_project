# mario_project
A world 1-1 recreation from super mario bros. (nes), made in conjuction with Henry Pham for a final project. Incomplete, requires LibGdX to run, made in eclipse but we're not sure if it'd work with other IDEs becaue of LibGDX

Due to files being lost, this is incomplete and uncomented

Worth noting, this contains the workspace which has to be imported into Eclipse or LibGDX though the code is located in the following path: core/src/com/mydgx/game/MyGdxGame.java

This was a group project, but most completed work was done by Julio Cinci
